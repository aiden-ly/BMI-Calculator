## Inspiration
We were inspired by the various BMI calculator websites that people commonly use and decided to make something similar, including extra information and advice.
## What it does
HealthMax takes your sex, age, height, weight, and activity level to determine your BMI and calories needed to gain or lose weight, depending on the most beneficial goal. It also gives you advice on how to reach those goals, such as low-calorie filling food for weight loss and calorie-dense foods for weight gain.
## How we built it
We used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in order to build the website and give it functionality.
## Challenges we ran into
Since we were not used to JavaScript, there were many functions and features that we had to research in order to understand what to do fully. Also, when creating the calculate function for BMI, we had to constantly debug using console.log(), which took up a lot of time. Additionally, there were many times were we had to brute force an element's position using CSS since we could not figure out how to properly adjust it. Overall, our code turned out extremely messy and hard to read.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We managed to create a program that works as intended and tried our best. While experimenting with CSS, we managed to make our website look even better through transitions and gradient animations.
## What we learned
We learned many new features about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that we didn't know before, along with having a greater understanding of how each of the three languages interact with each other. We also learned how to keep persisting whenever bugs show up and to properly fix them.
## What's next for HealthMax
We plan to try and add more features and information in order to make our program more unique and helpful. Some ideas we have are: a calorie tracker for meals, visuals for the BMI range, recipe recommendations depending on weight goal, and more.
